    The location contains a :py:class:`.Point` (in

    :py:class:`.Labware` or :py:class:`.Well` instance.

    It should rarely be constructed directly by the user; rather, it is the
    return type of most :py:class:`.Well` accessors like :py:meth:`.Well.top`
    and is passed directly into a method like
    :py:meth:`InstrumentContext.aspirate`.

    .. warning::
       The :py:attr:`labware` attribute of this class is used by the protocol
       API internals to, among other things, determine safe heights to retract
       the instruments to when moving between locations. If constructing an
       instance of this class manually, be sure to either specify `None` as the
       labware (so the robot does its worst case retraction) or specify the
       correct labware for the :py:attr:`point` attribute.


    .. warning::
       The `==` operation compares both the position and associated labware.
       If you only need to compare locations, compare the :py:attr:`point`
       of each item.
